        <p>Feel like your story is almost there but not quite clicking? That’s where I come in. Instead of just analyzing movies for you, we’ll watch them together—breaking down character motives, plot twists, pacing, and dialogue in real time. You’ll get instant feedback, brainstorming, and a deeper look at what works (and what doesn’t). By actively learning from the best and worst techniques, you’ll walk away with clear, practical insights to level up your own writing.</p>

        <p>Watching movies together isn’t just about critique—it’s about discovery. In a relaxed, engaging setting, we’ll explore what works, what doesn’t, and why. This back-and-forth helps me understand your creative vision and tailor feedback to your needs. Whether it’s character development, world-building, or plot structure, we’ll pull concrete lessons from film to spark fresh ideas. Think of it as a personalized masterclass in storytelling—unlocking the secrets of great narratives so you can craft stories that truly resonate.</p>
